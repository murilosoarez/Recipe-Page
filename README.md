    <p> This is the begginner's project made for the Odin Project Curriculum, an online course with a methodology focused on learning through practice. </p>
    <p> I struggled with this one for a while because i kept wanting to keep implementing new stuff, but ultimately decided to make this project a low level practice experience using the essentials for every webpage - <strong> HTML </strong> and <strong> CSS. </strong> </p>
