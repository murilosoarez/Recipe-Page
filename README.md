# Recipe-Page - The Odin Project

A simple HTML and CSS display of my favorite Brazillian recipes & it's culinary significance and history. This a simple project-study with application of raw HTML, JS and a *litle* bit of Tailwind as well. In this project i used Tailwind for the first time, experimented a bit with animations and hovering events and worked on improving my design thinking skills.
